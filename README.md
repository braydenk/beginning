# JavaScript-2020-Hipster-Starter

A small startup repo for your JavaScript project. It includes setup for:

* Webpack
* TypeScript
* React (styled-components)
* ESLint
* Prettier

## How to use it

Run `yarn` to get all the dependencies in place and choose on of the following:

* `yarn build` produces a production ready bundle `public/app.min.js`.
* `yarn watch` produces `public/app.js` (no server).
* `yarn dev` produces `public/app.js` and server is running on `localhost:9000` with live-reload enabled.
