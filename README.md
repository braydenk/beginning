# A new _Beginning_ in the world of JavaScript

A small starter kit repo for your JavaScript projects. It includes:

* Webpack + webpack-dev-server (live-reload and watcher)
* TypeScript
* React + styled-components
* ESLint/Prettier configured

## How to use it

Run `yarn` to get all the dependencies in place and choose on of the following:

* `yarn build` produces a production ready bundle `public/app.min.js`.
* `yarn watch` produces `public/app.js` (no server).
* `yarn dev` produces `public/app.js` and server is running on `localhost:9000` with live-reload enabled.
